   - **Success Indicators**: High service delivery numbers, strong CHW performance, good patient satisfaction
   - **Challenge Areas**: Technology maintenance, seasonal accessibility, sustainability concerns
   
   **Questions**: Develop an AI-powered post-mortem analysis approach that identifies root causes of challenges and success factors. What specific AI tools would be most valuable?

3. **Lessons Learned and Scaling Strategy**
   - **Replication Interest**: Government wants to scale to 5 additional provinces
   - **Adaptation Needs**: Different ethnic groups, varying geography, different disease patterns
   
   **Questions**: Create a comprehensive lessons learned framework and scaling analysis using AI tools. How would you assess replication feasibility and adaptation requirements?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Comprehensive approach to impact measurement and attribution
- Effective integration of AI tools with cultural sensitivity
- Systematic analysis of success factors and challenges
- Strategic thinking about knowledge capture and replication
- Realistic assessment of scaling opportunities and requirements
