# Chapter 2: Understanding AI for Social Impact

## Unit 3: Key Concepts of Artificial Intelligence

### Block 1

Welcome to Unit 3, where we explore **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simple, practical terms** for social good project managers. This unit will help you understand AI concepts without requiring technical expertise, focusing on how these tools can enhance your project management work.

As a project manager, you don't need to understand the complex technical details of AI.

By the end of this unit, you will feel confident about selecting and using AI tools that can make your social good projects more successful.

### Block 2

## What is Artificial Intelligence? (Simple Explanation)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is like having a very smart assistant that can help you with different tasks. Think of AI as computer programs that can learn patterns, make predictions, and help you make better decisions - similar to how an experienced colleague might offer advice based on their knowledge.

### Understanding AI in Everyday Terms

**AI as a Smart Helper**
Instead of thinking about complex algorithms, think of AI as different types of helpers:

- **The Research Assistant**: AI that can quickly read through hundreds of documents and summarize key points
- **The Data Analyst**: AI that can spot patterns in numbers and data that might take humans weeks to find
- **The Writing Helper**: AI that can help you write reports, emails, and project documents more clearly
- **The Translator**: AI that can help you communicate with communities in different languages
- **The Predictor**: AI that can help you anticipate potential problems or opportunities in your project

### Types of AI Tools for Project Managers

Based on PMI (Project Management Institute) recommendations, here are the main categories of AI tools that project managers find most useful:

Use the prompt examples provided in this course and adapt them to your specific situation. Start with similar projects and modify as needed.

### Common Concerns and How to Address Them

**"I'm not technical enough to use AI"**
- AI tools are designed for everyday users, not just technical experts
- Most tools work through simple conversation, like texting with a smart friend
- Start with basic tasks and gradually try more complex applications

**"Will AI replace my job as a project manager?"**
- AI is a tool to make you more effective, not to replace you
- Your human skills (empathy, cultural understanding, relationship building) are irreplaceable
- AI handles routine tasks so you can focus on strategic and relationship work

**"How do I know if AI suggestions are correct?"**
- Always review AI outputs with your professional judgment
- Verify important facts and figures from reliable sources
- Adapt suggestions to your local context and cultural considerations

### Block 7

## Ethical Considerations for Non-Technical Users

### Data Privacy and Confidentiality

**What You Need to Know**
- Don't share sensitive personal information about project beneficiaries with AI tools
- Be cautious about sharing confidential project details or financial information
- Use general examples rather than specific case details when asking for AI help

**Practical Guidelines**
- Instead of: "Maria Santos from Village X is struggling with..."
- Try: "A woman in our rural community is facing challenges with..."
- Avoid sharing specific names, addresses, or sensitive personal details
- Focus on general patterns and approaches rather than individual cases

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Remember AI Limitations**
- AI tools are primarily trained on Western, English-language content
- AI suggestions may not always be culturally appropriate for your context
- Always adapt AI outputs to respect local customs, values, and communication styles

**Best Practices**
- Use AI for initial drafts, then adapt for cultural appropriateness
- Consult with local community members about AI-generated materials
- Test AI-translated content with native speakers before using
- Combine AI efficiency with human cultural wisdom

### Community Consent and Transparency

**Being Transparent About AI Use**
- Let your team and stakeholders know when you're using AI tools to help with project work
- Explain that AI is helping you be more efficient, not making decisions for the project
- Ensure communities understand that human project managers are still in charge

### Block 8
