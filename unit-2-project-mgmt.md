# Chapter 1: Foundations of AI-Driven Social Good Projects

## Unit 2: Management of Social Good Projects

### Block 1

Welcome to Unit 2, where we delve into the fundamental principles of **project management for social good initiatives**. This unit will equip you with essential knowledge about the project lifecycle, stakeholder management, and the systematic approach needed to transform social problems into actionable project solutions.

Project management in the social good sector requires a unique blend of traditional project management methodologies with deep understanding of community needs, cultural sensitivities, and sustainable development principles.
