### The Five Phases of Project Management
### Block 3

**1. Project Initiation: "Getting Started Right"**

This is where you move from "We should do something about this problem" to "Here's exactly what we're going to do":

- **Understand the Problem**: Talk to communities to understand what they really need
- **Check Feasibility**: Make sure your idea is realistic and doable
- **Get Buy-In**: Ensure key people and organizations support your project
- **Define Success**: Be clear about what success looks like

*Example*: Before starting a women's literacy program, spend time in the community understanding why women aren't currently attending school, what obstacles exist, and what approaches might work.

**2. Project Planning: "Mapping Your Route"**

This is where you figure out exactly how to achieve your goals:

- **Create Detailed Plans**: Break your big goal into smaller, manageable steps
- **Organize Resources**: Figure out what people, money, and materials you need
- **Plan Timeline**: Decide when things will happen and in what order
- **Prepare for Problems**: Think about what could go wrong and how to handle it

*Example*: For the literacy program, plan which villages to start with, what curriculum to use, how to train teachers, and how to handle challenges like seasonal migration.

**3. Project Execution: "Making It Happen"**

This is where your plans become reality:

- **Coordinate Activities**: Make sure all the different parts of your project work together
- **Manage Your Team**: Keep everyone motivated, informed, and productive
- **Engage Communities**: Maintain strong relationships with the people you're serving
- **Stay Flexible**: Adapt when things don't go according to plan

*Example*: Actually delivering literacy classes, supporting teachers, engaging with families, and adjusting your approach based on what you learn.

**4. Project Monitoring and Control: "Staying on Track"**

This is where you keep checking progress and making adjustments:

- **Track Progress**: Regularly measure whether you're achieving your goals
- **Solve Problems**: Address issues quickly before they become bigger problems
- **Communicate**: Keep stakeholders informed about progress and challenges
- **Learn and Adapt**: Use what you learn to improve your approach

*Example*: Regularly checking attendance rates, testing learning progress, gathering feedback from participants, and adjusting teaching methods based on what's working.

**5. Project Closure: "Finishing Strong"**

This is where you wrap up activities and ensure lasting impact:

- **Complete Final Activities**: Finish all planned project work
- **Evaluate Impact**: Measure what you achieved and what you learned
- **Plan for Sustainability**: Ensure benefits continue after your project ends
- **Celebrate Success**: Recognize achievements and thank contributors

*Example*: Conducting final literacy assessments, training local people to continue the program, documenting lessons learned, and celebrating graduate achievements.


## From Problem to Project: The Theory of Change
### Block 4

**Theory of Change** is a simple but powerful tool that helps you think through how your project activities will lead to the changes you want to see. Think of it as a roadmap showing how you'll get from where you are now to where you want to be.

![Theory of Change Framework](assets/theory-of-change.png)

### Understanding Theory of Change
### Block 5

**The Basic Logic Chain:**
Your project should follow a logical sequence: "If we do A, then B will happen, which will lead to C, which will create the change we want."

**Example: Improving Child Nutrition Project**

Problem: Children in rural areas are malnourished


| **Theory of Change** | **Description**                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activities**       | Train mothers on nutrition and provide cooking demonstrations |
| **Outputs**          | 500 mothers receive nutrition training and cooking skills     |
| **Outcomes**         | Mothers prepare more nutritious meals for their children      |
| **Impact**           | Children's nutritional status improves significantly          |


| **Assumptions**                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| Mothers have time to attend training sessions       |
| Nutritious ingredients are available locally        |
| Families have resources to buy better food          |
| Cultural food preferences allow for dietary changes |

### Components of Theory of Change
### Block 6

**Activities (What You Do)**

These are the specific actions your project will take:

- Training sessions, workshops, meetings
- Distribution of materials or equipment
- Awareness campaigns and community outreach
- Capacity building for local organizations

**Outputs (What You Produce)**

These are the direct products of your activities:

- Number of people trained
- Materials distributed
- Facilities built or improved
- Organizations strengthened

**Outcomes (Changes That Happen)**

These are the changes in behavior, knowledge, or conditions:

- People use new skills or knowledge
- Behaviors change in positive ways
- Services improve in quality or accessibility
- Relationships and cooperation strengthen

**Impact (Long-term Change)**

This is the ultimate social change you're working toward:

- Reduced poverty or improved livelihoods
- Better health outcomes for communities
- Increased equality and empowerment
- Environmental improvements

### Testing Your Theory of Change
### Block 7

**Ask These Questions:**

- Are our assumptions realistic?
- Is each step in our logic chain actually connected to the next?
- Are we missing any important steps or factors?
- How will we know if our theory is working?


## Understanding Stakeholders: The People Who Matter
### Block 8

**Stakeholders** are all the people and organizations who affect or are affected by your project. Managing relationships with stakeholders is often the key to project success, especially in social good work where community support is essential.

- **Direct beneficiaries**: The people who will directly benefit from your project
- **Community members**: Families, neighbors, and community groups
- **Local leaders**: Village chiefs, religious leaders, respected elders
- **Community organizations**: Local groups, cooperatives, traditional institutions

*Example*: In a women's literacy project, primary stakeholders include the women who will attend classes, their families, village leaders who must approve the program, and existing women's groups.

**Supporting Stakeholders: The People Who Help You**

- **Project team**: Your staff, volunteers, and consultants
- **Partner organizations**: Other NGOs, government agencies, private companies
- **Funding organizations**: Donors, grant-makers, sponsors
- **Government authorities**: Local, regional, and national government officials

*Example*: Supporting stakeholders might include the literacy organization providing curricula, the local government education office, international donors funding the project, and community volunteers helping with classes.

**Influencing Stakeholders: The People Who Can Help or Hinder**
