# Chapter 1 – Understanding and Connecting the Dots: Introduction to Social Good, AI, and Projects

## Introduction

### Block 1

Welcome to **Managing AI-Driven Social Good Projects**, a comprehensive micro-credential course designed for emerging project managers and social entrepreneurs who want to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence for positive social impact. This course will guide you through the essential concepts, methodologies, and practical applications needed to successfully initiate, plan, execute, and evaluate social good projects that leverage AI technologies.

## Course Structure

### Block 2
This course is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

**Chapter 1 – Understanding and Connecting the Dots: Introduction to Social Good, AI, and Projects (Units 1–3):**
In this opening chapter, you will build a clear foundation of what “social good” means and how projects drive positive change in communities. You will also explore the essentials of artificial intelligence—what it is, what it can and cannot do, and how it can be used responsibly in non-technical settings. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how social impact goals, project thinking, and AI tools fit together to support meaningful and practical interventions.

**Chapter 2 – From Start to Finish: Managing the Project Cycle with AI (Units 4–8):**
The second chapter takes you through the entire lifecycle of a social-good project. You will learn to define needs, create project charters, plan work using simple structures, monitor progress, manage risks, and evaluate results. Each stage shows how AI tools can enhance clarity, reduce workload, and support decision-making, even without any programming. This chapter equips you with practical, step-by-step skills to move a project from idea to implementation and finally to evidence-based learning.

**Chapter 3 – Responsible Use of AI (Units 9–10):**
The final chapter focuses on fairness, privacy, transparency, and sustainability—core principles for using AI safely and ethically. You will learn to identify potential biases, protect sensitive data, engage communities transparently, and build trust into every AI-supported workflow. This chapter ensures that even simple AI applications are handled with care, accountability, and attention to long-term impact.

## Course Outcomes

### Block 3

By the end of this course:

* you will be able to turn real social problems into concrete, well-scoped projects, using simple tools and clear logic instead of technical jargon.
* you will be equipped to use AI tools to support every stage of the project cycle—problem framing, planning, implementation, monitoring, and impact evaluation—in a way that is practical even for non-technical teams.
* you will be capable of designing and running AI-supported interventions that are evidence-based, measurable through clear KPIs, and adapted to diverse contexts such as NGOs, public agencies, universities, and social enterprises in Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, and beyond.
* you will know how to monitor results, interpret data responsibly, document lessons learned, and turn them into decisions that improve the next cycle of your project.
* you will be able to recognize and reduce AI-related risks such as bias, unfair outcomes, privacy breaches, and lack of transparency, and to communicate clearly about how AI is used in your project.
* you will join a growing community of practitioners who use AI not as a buzzword, but as a careful, well-governed tool to amplify social impact and protect the people they serve.

Whether you want to design your first social-impact project, strengthen an existing program, or simply learn how to use AI in a responsible, hands-on way, this course will give you the structures, templates, and mindset you need to act with confidence. Get ready to design projects that are not only innovative, but also ethical, explainable, and genuinely useful for the communities you care about.

## Unit 1: Introduction to Social Good
### Block 4

In this first unit, we explore the fundamental concepts of social good, examine key areas where social impact can be achieved, and identify the various actors and interventions that contribute to meaningful change.
