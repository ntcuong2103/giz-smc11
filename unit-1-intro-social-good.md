# Chapter 1: Foundations of AI-Driven Social Good Projects

## Unit 1: Introduction to Social Good

### Block 1

Welcome to **Managing AI-Driven Social Good Projects**, a comprehensive micro-credential course designed for emerging project managers and social entrepreneurs who want to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence for positive social impact. This course will guide you through the essential concepts, methodologies, and practical applications needed to successfully initiate, plan, execute, and evaluate social good projects that leverage AI technologies.

In this first unit, we explore the fundamental concepts of social good, examine key areas where social impact can be achieved, and identify the various actors and interventions that contribute to meaningful change. By the end of this unit, you will have a clear understanding of what constitutes social good and be able to distinguish between initiatives that genuinely serve societal needs and those that may fall short of this mark.

## Understanding Social Good: Core Concepts

Social good refers to **actions, initiatives, or outcomes that benefit society as a whole, particularly marginalized or underserved communities**.

## Case Study: The Grameen Bank Model

**Background:**
In 1974, following a terrible famine in Bangladesh, Economics Professor Muhammad Yunus was deeply moved when he provided small loans totaling just $27 to 42 households. This modest investment enabled them to create products for sale, helping them escape poverty and avoid high-interest exploitative lending.

**Project Evolution:**
- 1976: Pilot microfinance model launched in villages around Chittagong University
- 1979: Project received support from Central Bank of Bangladesh and expanded to Tangail district
- 1983: Grameen Bank officially established and began nationwide operations
- Present: Serves over 7.3 million borrowers (97% women) across 80,200 villages

**Key Success Factors:**
- **Community-Centered Approach**: Focus on women borrowers and group-based lending
- **Sustainable Model**: 96.6% repayment rate demonstrating financial viability
- **Scalable Solution**: Model replicated in 40+ countries worldwide
- **Partnership Strategy**: Collaboration with government, international organizations, and social funds

**Tasks for Analysis:**
1. **Identify Stakeholders**: Map all actors involved in the Grameen Bank ecosystem
2. **Assess Impact Metrics**: Analyze quantitative and qualitative outcomes
3. **Evaluate Sustainability**: Examine the long-term viability of the model
4. **Explore AI Potential**: Propose how AI could enhance current operations

**Keywords for Understanding:**
- Microfinance, financial inclusion, women's empowerment, community development, social entrepreneurship, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, stakeholder engagement, impact measurement

## Assessment: Mini-Case Analysis

**Scenario:**
You are working with a local NGO in a developing country that wants to improve access to clean water in rural communities. The NGO has identified three potential approaches:

1. **Charity Model**: Donate water purification tablets and filters to communities
2. **Infrastructure Model**: Build centralized water treatment facilities
3. **Empowerment Model**: Train community members to maintain water systems and establish local water management committees

**Context for Analysis:**
The target communities have limited technical expertise, inconsistent electricity supply, and strong traditional governance structures. Previous aid projects in the region have had mixed results, with some creating dependency and others failing due to lack of local buy-in.

**Questions:**
1. Which approach best exemplifies social good principles and why?
2. What role could AI technologies play in each model?
3. How would you measure success for your chosen approach?
4. What potential challenges might arise, and how would you address them?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Understanding of social good principles
- Analysis of stakeholder needs and capacities
- Consideration of sustainability and local ownership
- Creative thinking about AI integration opportunities
- Practical awareness of implementation challenges
